# üëã Hey! I'm Venus
I'm a British designer, and I'm trying to make my dreams come true. It's becoming true though. I'm the CEO of AmeOS, and this is the website where you'll see silly designs, turn into an amazing OS, full of features!
# üßë‚Äçüíª Stuff I work on
- **AmeOS Panamint**: A unique Linux distro based on Arch, focused on primarily design and productivity.
- **AmeOS for Android**: The most anticipated released of AmeOS *ever*. It's the most beautiful Android custom ROM to date, with so much customization included!
- **Unbound**: Working with [@stell1x](https://github.com/stell1x), we're attempting to bridge the internet, and also making it fun. And no, it's impossible for it to die off, it's based on Bluesky.

Thanks,
